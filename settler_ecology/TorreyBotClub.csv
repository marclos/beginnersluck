"1879-06-01","323. Washingtonia.-The name Washingtonia, which was proposed by Kellogg to displace Lindley's Wellingtonia, and both of which had to give way before Endlicher's Sequoia, is now proposed for a Palm which has hitherto been referred to two different genera. This Palm, first known as Brahea filifera and then as Pritchardia filifera, is believed by Mr. Hermann Wendland (Botanische Zeitung), to possess sufficient differences to constitute it a species of a genus different from that of Pritchardra, and which he would name, as above stated, Washingtonia.","http://www.jstor.org/stable/2475725"

"1875-02-01","? 12. Silphium--Are Silphium integrifolium and S. trifolia- tum, now regarded as two distinct species or only varieties of one ? I am inclined to the view that they are only varieties. While botanizing on the Western prairies, I have often found two varieties so varying in their characters as to render it very difficult to deter- mine where they should be placed-whether under S. integrifolium or S. trifoliatum as described by Gray. In 1866, on the prairies of Kansas, I found eighteen stalks or stems growing from one and the same root. Eleven of these stems had their leaves all opposite in pairs. Seven of them were trifoliate from the lowest to the upper- most leaves. Stems grooved, rather rough, but not 4-angular save a few which were very slightly so: about 5? high : panicle loose: achenia not answering perfectly to the description of either of the above mentioned species.

Among the myriads of plants, I have noticed the following abnor- malities: (i) Dozens of plants have very deep blue sepals with a white or light blue margin. All of these are absolutely stamenless, though pollen was found upon the stigmas, whither it must have been brought by insects. (2) Numbers of flowers were pure white, and all of these had nine sepals and bore-as far as the flowers were concerned-an exact resemblance to A. nemorosa. One monosepalous flower was found with six lobes, one of which was cleft to its centre, thus forming, with a stameniferous extra sepal, nearly an 8-sepaled specimen. Binghampton, N. Y. C. F.

Panicle pyramidal, open, 2 to 3 inches long and 1 to 1? wide; rays in threes or fives be- low, above in twos or single, capillary, the longest an inch or more in length, flowering above the middle, spreading or erectish. Spike- lets very small (less than a line long); glumes acute, purplish, lower one a little shorter and broader; flowering-glume thin, obtusish, 3- nerved above, a little shorter than the outer glumes, unawned; palet very minute or wanting. Collected on the San Bernardino Mts., California, by the Parish Brothers. AGROSTIS HUMILIS.-Perennial, tufted. Culms 4 to 6 inches high, naked above, I to 2 leaves below the middle; leaves mostly at the base,1 to 2 inches long, narrow, not rigid, mostly erect; ligule short, auricled. Panicle 1 to 1x- inches long, narrow and few-flowered, branches short, mostly in threes below, above in twos or single, ap- pressed, the larger branches subdivided and with two to five spikelets. Spikelets purple, less than a line long, outer glumes ovate-lanceo- late, acute, smooth; flowering-glumes nearly as long as the outer ones, five-nerved, minutely toothed at the apex, unawned; palet hyaline, two-thirds as long as its flowering-glume. Has the appearance of small forms of A. varians, but that species has no palet. Found by W. N. Suksdorf on Mt. Paddo, Washington Territory, and by Mr. Howell on Mt. Adams. Grows in compact tufts in moist places.","http://www.jstor.org/stable/2476946"

It is not so important that the names of plants should meet with the approval of someone's more or less highly cultivated and cer- tainly individualized esthetic sense, as it is that they should be made to conform to some simple and iron-clad law.

Resolved. That the Torrey Botanical Club of New York sends its greetings to Dr. Asa Gray on the attainment of his seventy-fifth birthday, and its congratulations that it finds him in the enjoyment of health, the full possession of all his great powers and undiminished enthusiasm in the science to which he has devoted his life. Resolved. That we tender to Dr. Gray our gratitude for the splendid contribu- tions he has made to American botany, and our heartfelt wishes that many years of activity and happiness may yet be added to his already long and useful life.

Let me return my sincere thanks for the honor you have paid me and the pleas- ure you have given me by the congratulations which the Torrey Club has sent through you, on the occasion of my seventy-fifth birthday, with which I have been deeply touched and gratified. With best wishes to you all personally, and for the prosperity of the Club which has so honored and venerated a name, I remain Sincerely yours, ASA GRAY. Mr. O. R. Willis read a number of reminiscences of some of our earlier botanists--Torrey, Rafinesque, Short and others.

"1884-06-01","Teratology.-A head of the ox-eye daisy (Chrysanthemum leucan- themum, L.) has just been brought to me by a lady (Mrs. Cowles) living in Hamden which has the rays replaced by white tubular corollas one-quarter of an inch long, gradually ampliated outwards, and irreg- ularly 5-lobed. Most of these corollas are somewhat bilabiate, with three parts in the lower lip, and two, a little smaller, in the upper. The veins of the lobes are submarginal and unite below the sinuses, as in the normal disc-flowers of the order. These ray-flowers have both stamens and a short, included style, like that of the disc-flowers. The ray-flowers are in general structure comparable to those of Chaenactis, but there are no gradations from them to the disc-flowers in this specimen. Is this condition to be explained by a simple re- version of the usual rays to a form more like that of the disc-flowers, or by supposing the ray-flowers to be deficient, and the exterior disc- flowers to be enlarged so as to replace the rays? One of these ex- terior flowers, which I dissected, had the ovule well developed, and it is probable that all would have been fertile. Mrs. Cowles tells me that the plant bore six heads like the one sent to me. New Haven, June, 1884. DANIEL C. EATON.","http://www.jstor.org/stable/2477026"

Britton near the same place in 1877, as recorded in the BULLETIN, Vol. vi, pp. 56, 178. On the 26th of August, this year, I found this plant growing abun- dantly and wide-spread over a stony hillside pasture near the Parker Notch, about two miles north of Tannersville, in the Catskills of Greene Co., N. Y., at an elevation of about' 2,500 feet. It seems likely to become a permanent resident, for its prolific runners enable it to increase with rapidity, and the farmers there are already complaining of it as a troublesome, bitter weed. At the above date the plants were just coming into flower, the scapes being only 3 to 6 inches in height. A week or two later would find them in full maturity and of the size of European specimens.* Philadelphia, Sept. 6, 1881. JOHN H. REDFIELD.","http://www.jstor.org/stable/2477318"

"1874-07-01","99. Rumex Patientia, L.--This introduced species of Rumex appears to be little known, though it has been in the country for two hundred years. Is it actually rare, or has it commonly been overlooked ? Our Manuals of Botany do not furnish us with much light on the subject. This plant has been known for a number of years in Amherst, Mass., and during the past three seasons we have found it not rarely in the neighboring towns, growing with R. crispus and R. obtusifolius under the same conditions and as thriftily as either of these species. It is still more common at Highgate Springs, Vt., where for miles it may be seen on the roadside, and increasingly common as you cross the Canada line. Specimens from all these localities have been submitted to competent authority and determined. Will not some of the readers of the BULLETIN interest themselves in the matter, and, by furnishing complete and mature specimens of all the less known Rumices in their vicinity, assist in determin- ing more fully the range and character of the genus under con- sideration ?

Sprague; found also by the same collector, at Todos los Santos, Lower California; spermogones not observed. In the only other known species comparable with this, inasmuch as the slender divisions pass above into, and are beset with black fibrils (R. melanothrix, Laur., known only from the Cape of Good Hope, Drege!) the spermogones are described as black. The tufts of our plant vary from one and a half to three inches in height in the speci- mens seen as yet, and the width of the divisions from 2mn to more than an inch. The general aspect of the lichen suggests the stock of R. calicaris.","http://www.jstor.org/stable/2485415"

"1884-01-01","The Involucre in Malvaceae.-Referring to Prof. W. W. Bailey's statement in the BULLETIN for December, 1883, that a greenhouse specimen of Abutilon had been found with traces of an involucre, I am happy to be able to say that a 3-leaved involucre is normally present in the young flowers of the common velvet-leaf (A. Avicennae) and also in the greenhouse species, A. vexillarium (one of the bract- lets long, the others short.) These facts, taken along with the pres- ence generally of a hypocalycine node in the 'non-involucrate' Mal- vaceae, suggest that the distinction between them and their involu- crate allies is unwarranted, the real distinction being that in some the involucre is fugacious. In some of the genera there are difficulties in the way of verifying this view, arising chiefly from the bristly character of the young flower-buds. Princeton, N. J. G.

"1882-06-01","Notes from Massachusetts.-During the present spring I have examined a large number of the plants of Symiplocarpus foetidus, Salisb., with a view to observing malformations, with the following result. More than a dozen spathes were found which contained a second spathe within the outer one. Their relative positions varied. In some specimens the inner spathe opened in the same direction as the outer, in others it faced directly opposite, and in others it occu- pied intermediate positions between these. Each specimen contained a perfect spadix. All the spathes in one cluster (8) presented this change. Several specimens were found which were perfectly normal with the exception that the spadix was abortive, very minute and imperfect. One had no trace whatever of a spadix. Inciden- tally it was noted that the flowers were much frequented by our com- mon honey-bees. Indeed, with one or two accidental exceptions, I have noticed no other insects about them. Prof. Bailey's observation on the lack of male flowers in the alders this spring finds abundant confirmation in this locality. The peculiar season seems to have worked confusion among our spring flowers. The rare Nardosmia palmata, Hook., found at a single sta- tion in this region, has this season almost wholly failed to put forth flowers. Not half a dozen specimens have been collected where usually hundreds are found, although quantities of the palmate leaves testify to the vitality of the roots. Amherst, Mass., May 5th, 1882.

"1882-08-01","Botanical Literature. Our Native Ferns and their Allies, with Synoptical Descriptions of the American Pteridophyta North of Mexico. By Lucien M. Underwood, Ph. D. 2d edition. Bloomington, Ill. 1882. A little more than a year ago a neat and modest volume made its appearance under the title of ""Our Native Ferns,"" which appears to have met with so much success that the author has disposed of his entire edition and now comes forward with a second, enlarged so as to include the entire Pteridophyta of the United States. That portion devoted to the Ferns remains substantially the same as in the first-edition, with only such changes and additions as were necessary to bring the work forward to date and make it complete-a fact which shows how much care the author bestowed upon his book in the first place, and guarantees the trustworthiness of the present edition; but the addition of the remaining vascular cryptogams greatly increases the value of the book, and makes it doubly useful to all who seek to study this class of plants. The author tells us in his preface that he has spared no pains to make his book thoroughly reliable (a fact of which the book itself fur- nishes sufficient evidence), and has therefore consulted freely the descriptive works of the highest authorities in order to ensure cer- tainty in his descriptions. There is no apparent disposition, however, to follow others, unless by so doing his own purposes may be the better carried out, but, on the contrary, the author shows much originality of thought, and inde- pendence of judgment in the treatment of his work throughout. The elementary part is clear, and well calculated to introduce be- ginners to the study of the plants treated of. The excellent key makes the analysis of the ferns comparatively easy. Of the other plants it is enough to say that their treatment rests upon such author- ities as Dr. Engelmann for the Isoetes, Spring for the Lycopodiaceae, and Milde for the Equiseta. The writer can personally testify to the earnestness and fidelity with which the author has sought to make his work complete, and cordially commends the book to all. It should be in the hands of all who are especially interested in the vascular Cryptogams of the United States.-G. E. D.","http://www.jstor.org/stable/2477238"

The paper announced "" On some new Species of Nitella,"" was presented by Dr. Allen. Two new species, N. Blankiis/zzipii and N. stricta, were exhibited and described, and their relation to known species commented upon. Dr. Allen also remarked at leng,th on the desirability of es- tablishing a uniform method of botanical pronunciation, alluding especially to the tbree methods of Latin pronunciation in use at the present time. The subject was further discussed by Dr. Mo- rong, and Dr. Britton. Dr. Morong spoke concerning the life and work of Rafinesque, remarking on his genius and acute powers of discrimination, stating that he agreed with Professor Greene that many more of the genera and species described by him mtust be recognized. He made especial mention of the recent publication of RafinesquLe's will, by Mr. Thos. Meehan, in the columns of the Plhiladelphida Ledger. Dr. Britton showed a specimen of Eleoclharis at rop ii-piirea, found by Dr. Wibbe in Fillmnore Co., Nebraska, greatly extend- ing its range to the north. TUESDAY EVENING, APRIL 13TH.

Mr. Pilaf was a native of Austria, and had important positions before political troubles induced him to come to this country. He was connected with the Park from its inception, and held charge of carrying out the details of the plan. How well he performed his part, that noble work bears ample wituess. Mr. Pilat published in Austria, a work on Elementary Botany but, though an ardent lover of the science, his occupations allowed him but little time to devote to it in this country. Still he was familiar with our native plants, and when the ground, now occupied by the Park, was taken possession of, he prepared a full catalogue of the wild plants found there.

Among the visitors were Dr. Newberry and Messrs. Froebel, Neerbach, and T. Hogg. Dr. Torrey and Mr. Redfield had during the summer recess visited the Western part of the Continent. One of the spoils brought back was a gigantic Pterospora Andromedea, Nutt., over four feet in height. Dr. Newberry exhibited a fossil Onoclea, undistinguishable from O. sensibilis, L., with the venation perfectly preserved. This specimen was from the Miocene of the Upper Missouri.","http://www.jstor.org/stable/2477505"

McCorn were elected active members, and Ensign W. E. Safford, U. S. N., and E. C. Smith, of Augusta, Maine, corresponding mem- bers. Dr. Newberry exhibited a new, pear-shaped variety of orange, recently received in the New York markets from Southern California, and remarked on the progress of orange culture in that region. Mrs. Britton distributed specimens of Aspidizu spinu- losum, Willd., var. dilatatum, Eaton, and A. cristatum, Swartz, in several forms, some of them approaching var. Clintonianum, Eaton, from Boonton, New Jersey, and exhibited Alyssum in- canum, L., from Dedham, Massachusetts, where, in July, 1882, it was abundant along the railroad and apparently naturalized; it is native of Central Europe. Mr. P. H. Dudley read some further notes on the formation of ducts in chestnut wood. Mr. Schrenk remarked on the phenomena of certain leaves of shedding water, especially those of Impatiens, which have a perfectly smooth epi- dermis, and attributed it to the abundance of cutine. Those of the Snowberry have a similar power. Dr. Newberry called atten- tion to a similar action by the velvety leaves of Abutilon Avicenne. Dr. Britton exhibited specimens of the Dusty Miller, Senecio Cine- raria, DC., collected by Prof. E. H. Day on the sea beach of Monmouth County, New Jersey, and remarked that it had now been noticed at several places on the beaches in the vicinity of New York, and might well be regarded as adventive; also Carex ptychocarpa, Steud., from Lake Hopatcong. Ensign W. E. Saf- ford, U. S. N., read the announced paper of the evening, entitled ""A comparison of the Flora of Ross County, Ohio, with that of Southern New England.""

"1877-07-01","? 1.65. Borago.-This is the spelling of the word we find in Lin- naeus, but of late years the double r has come into use. This change appears to have originated among the botanists on the continent of Europe, and to have gradually made its way into England and to this side of the Atlantic. Whatever the origin of the word, it seems to obtain in some form among both the Latin and Germanic nations, among the latter, however, more frequently with one r. As the double r is now adopted by so many eminent authorities, it seems advisable to abandon the Linnaean spelling, and write Borrago, Borraginaceae, though we shall hardly change the English word Borage. It is curious to notice how little reliance can be placed upon spelling in a quotation. For we find Lindley, for example, quoting Tournefort, in his index, for Borrago, but in his list of genera, Borago.","http://www.jstor.org/stable/2476641"

Bud Variation in Bananas.-Fritz Miller writes (:Va- ture, June 12): ""In my garden there is a large plant (planted about eleven years ago) of a variety of banana, distinguished by purplish stems and petioles, red fruits, and by a very peculiar flavor of the latter. From the centre of this plant, covered by the rotten stems of former years, there are now growing green stems, with green petioles; one of them has already produced fruits, which were green when im- mature, and yellow when ripe, and the flavor of which I found to be but slightly altered. All the young stems growing from the circum- ference of the plant are purplish. May not many of the varieties of bananas have been produced by bud variation ?""","http://www.jstor.org/stable/2475732"

This form is so strikingly different from V. sagittata, Ait., that I, at first, believed it to be a distinct species, but Dr. Gray says it is a form of sagittata, and suggests the possibility of insect agency having produced the white forms. Specimens since found, however, seem to indicate a gradual variation from blue to white. H, H. RUSBY. Terms-One Dollar per annum beginning with the January number.

"1883-02-01","Distribution of Weeds.-Among the means whereby weeds are distributed, their being generally objectionable to cattle should not be overlooked. When in North Carolina, I noticed that wherever Verbesina Siegesbeckia had to struggle unaided with other native vege- tation there were only plants here and there among scores of other species of vegetation. When it was growing in a pasture or along the roadside where cattle ate, it soon took possession of the whole surface, simply because cattle kept other species from seeding, while avoiding this, and thus it had the whole ground to itself. It is very often an argument that an introduced plant is better adap- ted to the new location than the native, because it seems to spread so rapidly; but in most cases it may be because cattle will not touch it, and there happen to be few other competitors of its class. It gets the whole field to itself. The ox-eye daisy and the buttercup spread so amazingly quite as much because cattle let them go to seed as that the climate or soil is unusually favorable. Around our large cities, Stramonium, wild chamomile, Canada thistle, worm- seed and other well-known weeds spread only because goats, sheep, cows and geese avoid them, and they have thus nothing to interfere with their rapid spread. These remarks are suggested by an idea thrown out in a foreign periodical I have just been reading, that the great spread of some European weeds in America is a proof that they have found a soil and climate superior to those "" for which they were specially created.""

Masters says, that "" fusion frequently accompanies an increase in the number of cotyledons,"" and attributes the phenomenon, at least in some cases, to chorisis or to a cleavage of the original cotyledon.

"1885-08-01","On the General Exuberance of Pollen.-It seems to me, as I read, that a want of power to make legitimate deductions from facts is a common weakness with otherwise intelligent observers, and this occurs to me particularly when the subject happens to have relation to the cross-fertilization of flowers. Before me is a paper contributed to that excellent serial, the London Gardeners' Chronicle, on the cross-breeding of cereals,"" in which the author lays great stress on the fact that this class of plants-one may say the whole order of Gramineae consists of self-fertilizers. He points out how the pollen begins to shed, and the stigmas are in receptive condition before the florets expand, and that the objects for which anthers are formed "" are fully accomplished before the stamens make their appearance outside the ear."" But after this the anthers give out to the atmosphere an enormous amount of waste pollen, as any one walking through a grain field at that particular period has reason to know by his well smudged clothing. It has been found that an anther of wheat contains 6,864 grains, and that it takes 390,000 of them to weight but one grain. Rye pollen is heavier than that of wheat, or is yielded in larger quantity, for he gives 2 cwt. as the product per acre, while 50 lbs. is the pol- len-product of an acre of wheat. He then emphasizes the fact that wheat, barley and oats are fertilized before the anthers are visible outside. After a while the reason for the usual abundance of pollen is sought for, and our author concludes ""that the clouds of pollen in excess of customary requirements are but the exuberant provision by which nature has rendered the assurance of reproduction doubly secure."" Exuberant is a good word, but ""doubling"" when the figures are 6,864 to the X required, is certainly placing the lion's share of the two halves of the double on the side of ""exuberance."" But what one who is accustomed to look for logical sequence can see in ""assur- ance of reproduction "" by giving pollen to the winds in the case of plants that self-fertilize-fertilize before the florets expand-is inex- plicable. I think it must be admitted that not even with exuber- ance before us can this cloud of pollen have relation to any service to the plant, individually or collectively. I would submit that the reasons given in my Montreal address are more logical, i. e., that plants are made to contribute to the general good, just as we are.

Austin collected it in some abundance at Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1868. It seems to have gained an extended footing in this coun- try, and may be regarded a well-established species.

Vii-inica as indigenous to New Jersey, it being plentiful on the bank of Crossick's Creek, near the mill at Walnford in Monmouth County. The plant has been long established, and is found in various places along the stream for a mile or two north and south of WValnford. I have to announce a new and richer station for this plant on the Raritan River in Somer- set County, having received from iMiss Sarah E. Veghte an elegant specimen of it. She writes: "" This flower is found in great abun- dance in many places .along the Raritan River. This specimen was taken from woods about one mile and a half west of the village of Raritan, opposite the summer residence of Secretary Frelinghuysen."" Abnor-malforrm.-Three years ago I transferred some good roots from Walnford to my garden, but not until last spring did they bear any perfect flowers, and then not in their wild profusion, nor did they matture any seeds. One of the plants gave flowers nearly every one of which was prettily abnormal. Instead of the normal form, on the smooth tube of the flower several wart-like bosses or spurs were developed. Some of the flowers had five of these protu- berances, according with the pentamerous mouth of the trumpet. The very effect was odd, but decidedly pretty. I ho ped to get seeds in order if possible to perpetuate the form, but failed. I should add that the outer sides of the long tlhroat or tube of the abnormal flowers were as many-sided as there were bosses. SAMUEL LOCKWOOD.","http://www.jstor.org/stable/2476348"

Mix thoroughly and keep in a wide-mouthed glass jar. Brush off any dirt that clings to the fungus, and drop the freshly gathered plant into the liquid. I have beside me a large jar of plants that were collected in the summer of 1879. They are now in a perfect state of preservation. They have diminished somewhat in size, but their structure is pre- served, and the larvae are effectually destroyed. The liquid often gets filled with sediment and floating particles, to free it from which I pour it off, strain it through a piece of thin muslin and return it to the plants. Baltimore, Md. MARY E.

After the reading of the minutes the President announced the death of Mr. W. H. Leggett, and remarked at some length upon his life, character and attainments. Judge Brown and Mr. Gerard were appointed a Committee to draft resolutions proper to the occa- sion. Plants Exhibited.-Mr. Chamberlin exhibited a collection of marine algae gathered in New York Harbor, and, with it, a number of different forms of a species of Grinnellia. The President showed the floating-bladder of a species of Macrocystis from California and gave an account of the plant which bore it. Mr. Schrenk ex- hibited a specimen, preserved in fluid, of a seedling Iris, showing a peculiar mode of germination. Preservation of Specimens of Coniferae.-Mr. Schrenk stated that, after an unsuccessful trial of many expedients for the preservation of specimens of Coniferae for the herbarium, he had found that by soaking the specimen in Wickersheimer's preservative fluid it was rendered flexible, and no longer showed a tendency to shed its leaves after being pressed and mounted. One corresponding and two active members were elected. At the regular meeting held Tuesday evening, May 9th, the President occupied the Chair and twenty-three persons were present. Resolutions expressive of the Club's respect for the late Mr. Leg- gett, and of its sympathy with his relatives in their bereavement, were read and adopted, and a draft of the same was directed to be transmitted to the family. The Herbarium.-The Chairman of the Herbarium Committee announced the receipt of a gift to the Club's herbarium, from Mr. Geo. E. Davenport, of a collection of Alaskan ferns. Plants Exhibited.-Mr. Braman exhibited a small collection of fresh specimens of plants sent from Wisconsin by Mrs. C. T. Tracy, comprising the following species: Anemone patens, L., var. Nutta- lliana, Gray; Isopyrum biternatum, T. & G.; Trillium grandiflorum, Salisb.; and Erythronium albidum, Nutt. Mr. Schrenk showed a seed- ling Iris growing in a flower-pot, and exhibiting the same peculiari- ties in its mode of germination as the preserved specimen exhibited by him at the last meeting. The President exhibited the leaves of a number of species of Platanus and remarked upon the manner in which, in the West, the seeds of P. occidentalis are disseminated in the spring.","http://www.jstor.org/stable/2476054"

Prefatory.-The object of this Bulletin is primarily to formn a me- (lihin of communication for all those interested in the Flora otthis vi- cinity, and thus to bring together and fln into a flame the sparks of Bo- tanical enthusiasm, at present too much isolated. An attentive study of planlts in their native haunts is essenitial to the advance ot t lie sci- ence and in this respect tlhe local observer has an advantage over the expl6rer of extensive regiions, or the possessor of a gener:al ler- barium. He can note the plaant from its cradle to its grave; call watch its struggles for existence, its habits, its mig,rations, its vari- ations; can study its atmospherio and entomological econonlics; can speculate on its r elations to the past, or experiment on its uitility to man. It would be il vain to attemupt to cnuimerate all the poiits ,about which a lover of vegetable nature can lear n aind repolrt some- thing new. Botany, like every otler science, far fiom being ex- hauiste-d, is ever widenin(r its fieid. We hope, therefore, to have no lack of interesting communications, not only fiom deep investiga- tors, but fi-om all wlo mneet with interesting facts,-for w%ve wish it to be distinctly understood, that we have chiefly in view the devel- opment of a greater Botanical interest in ouir neighborhoo(, and found our hopes of success as much upon learners as upon tihe learned. While the Bulletin will be chiefly devoted to the local Flora of New-York, it will not exclude matters of general Botanical interest, of whichv we hope correspondents will keep it informed. Such papers of value as ar e too lonog for the regular sheet, will be issued in a supplemenit of firotmi two to four pages at a tinwe. The terms upon which the Bulletin can be issued will depend uipon the number of its supporters. We suppose at l)i'esent thia-t w^re can iiur- nish each of thirty subscribers at five dollars a year with ten colpies, but must wait for a little experience.

Abundant in a little valley in Oahu, at 2,500 feet above the sea; Hon. D. D. Baldwin, I878. The rhizomai may be elongated and creeping, but having seen only the ends of rhizomes bearing half a dozen clustered fronds, I am unable to say whether it is long or short. The fronds .are from three to six inches long, the shorter ones lanceolate and bi-pinnatifid, the larger ones ovate-lanceolate and tri-pinnatifid. The very short and hirsute or hispid stalks, and the shorter and more delicately membranaceous segments will easily distinguish it from H. recurvumii. H. scabruwn, of New Zealand, is a larger and coarser plant, and has the hairs of the stalk heavier and composed of very short articulations, while in H. Baluidinii the hairs have very long joints, and taper from a slightly swollen base to a long and very delicate point. I take pleasure in naminig it for a gentle- man who has shown great interest in the cryptogamic vegetation of the Hawaiian Islands. Mr. Baldwin has also sent specimeens of Trichiomnanes pyxidiferum, Linn., a species which is, I believe, new to the Hawaiian Islands. He reports that it is abundant in certain localities in Maui. D.

[New York, December, 1870. 96, The Club.-During the sumimer of 1866, two enthusiasts fre- quelitly klnocked at the door of Dr. Torrey's Herbarium in Colum- bia College. They were always greeted with two hands, an(d derivecl great pleasure in cliscussinag soime new plant found in the vicinity, or in comparing curious varieties and sports of familiar species. They had hearcl vague rumors of the existence of other collectors, ruimors confirmed by the mysterious disappearence of a secluded patch of (Cardainie preteensts, which had been left a few days to perfect. The desire was frequently expressed to try to assemble these workers ; so the effort was macle. The meetings gradually increased in size and interest, until it became evident that we possessed a working force. The Torrey semi-centennial of Dec. 20th, 1867, still further united the members, and the present organ- ization was effectecl. The following is a list of the officers and members of the club. As the association is rather iniformial, and somewhat fluctuating, we hope that errors and deficiencies will be pardoned. We have lost by death one member, AV. AS. Denslow, one of the earliest, nost enthusiastic, and, with the disadvantage of feeble health, one of the most indefatigable. No one had studied so carefully the plants on the northern end of this islandc: unfortunately we have but a partial report of his observations. Offlicers. JOHN TORREY, M. D., LL.

Trees and Rain.-The influence of trees upon rains and the general moisture of the atmosphere, which has been so much dis- cussed of late, receives a strong illustration from the island of Santa Cruz, W. I. A friend who spent the months of February, March and April last upon the island, informs me that, wheni he was there twenty years ago, the island was a garden of freshness, beauty and fertility. Woods coverecl the hills, trees were everywhere abundant, and rains were profuse and frequent. Tile memory of its loveliness called him there at the beginnilng of the present year, when, to his astonisllment, he found about one-third of the island, which is about twenty-five miles long, an utter desert. The forests and trees generally bad been cut away, rain-falls had ceased, and a process of desiccation beginning at one end of the land had advanced graduially and irre- sistibly upon the island, until for seven miles it is dried and deso- late as the sea-shore. Houses ancd beautiful plantations have been abandoned, and the people watch the advance of desolation, unable to arrest it, but knowing, almost to a certainty, the time when their own habitations, their gardens and fresh fields, will become a part of the waste ; the whole island seems doomed to become a desert. The inhabitants believe, and my friend confirms their opinion, that this sad result is due to the destruction of the trees upon the island some years ago. J. S.

"1901-09-01","Dacryopsis Ellisiana Massee By GEORGE MASSEE In Mr. Durand's interesting resealches oIn the genus Holzwaya Sacc., which appeared in the June numnber of this journal, the author has clearly proved that Holzwy gi,',iazl Durand has a conidial form. This conidial form Durand calls CGlj'lz' Ellisii lBerk. Some years ago I gave a full diagnosis * of CGo'izc El/isii Berk., drawn up from the type specimen, and discovering that it was a Basidiomycete, named it Dacry/ops/s Ellislauia. Arguing from the material Durand supposed to be Cor'/ze' Ellisii Berk., this author remarks as follows ""The matter was further greatly complicated when Massee, in 1894, described the type of Corynze Ellis/i, making it one of the types of a new genus of the Basidiomycetes, called Dac;yops/s."" I have again examined Berkeley's type and find that my previous description is correct. The plant resembles a little stout- handled drumstick. The head for some time consists of very slender conidiophores bearing very minute conidia; at a later stage bifurcate basidia also appear in the head. The explanation is quite simple. The Corii)e Ellisii of Durand is not the Coryiye Ellisii of Berkeley. Why Duraind has made such a mistake I am not able to say. The type specimen of Coryie Ellisii Berk. is in excelleint condition, and I have sent a fragment of it to Mr. Durand. I observe that the specimen in Ellis, N. Amer. Fung. 1383, called ""Cory;u' Ellisii Berk. (= Stilbliz ga-aziteuini Pk.),"" although superficially resembling Co;yiie Ellisii Berk., is in reality a very different fungus, and probably illustrates what Durand has been dealing with and who, like Burt in his paper, "" Is there a Basidi- omycetous stage in the life history of some Ascomycetes,"" had been misled by accepting the specimen in the exsiccati quoted above as representing the species described by Berkeley. The above account illustrates the value of a type-specimen, i. e., the actual specimen on which the species was founded, and not another specimen supposed to represent the same species. It urther illustrates the advisability of being quite certain about your species before venturing to indicate mistakes made by others. * Tour. Mvc. 6 I-8I. :/. 7. f. 10-21. I89I.

This decision was based on numerous sections of the living prothal- lium, and has since been found to be in- correct. In microtome sections, (see fig. a.) the ventral canal-cell (b.) is very evi- dent, and is plainly derived from the ceng tral cell. In the upper canal-cell, two nuclei may usually be readily seen, but in no cases observed was the cell divided. 2. On sectioning one prothallium, perfectly developed archegonia were noticed both above and below (Fig. b.) and subsequent examination showed numerous other instances of the same thing; in several of these prothallia, embryos developed from archegonia upon the upper surface. Is this a case of reversion to an ancestral form having archegonia above as in liver-worts ? Unfortunately the fern from which these came could not be de- termined. DOUGLAS H. CAMPBELL.

This fern is not recognized in the Synopsis Filicum, and Fournier has referred it to W. mollis, which is a larger and much more rigid fern, and has the involucre at first sub-globose, and enclosing the sori. The true W. Mexicana has the involucre cleft almost to the base into 3 to 5 segments, and these divided half-way down or more into a few slender articulated filaments, much as in W. Oregana, but on the whole decidedly more conspicuous. The fronds vary from 3 to 8 inches long, and might easily pass for W. obtusa, but for the involucre. The segments of the frond are finely but rather deeply toothed, and the teeth end in delicate and semi-transparent tips which are ciliated in the young fronds. When the fronds are mature this ciliation mostly disappears, and the involucre is lost, and then it becomes difficult to distinguish the fronds from those of W. Oregana on one side, and W. obtusa on the other. To W. Mexicana I refer Drs. Parry and Palmer's No. i,ooo, from near San Luis Potosi, Mexico; Dr. Palmer's plants from Coahuila; Mr. George R. Vasey's (son of Dr. Vasey, of the Agricultural De- partment, Washington) from Organ Mts., New Mexico (just re- ceived); Rev. E. L. Greene's No. 430, from Pinos Altos Mts., and Mr. Rusby's New Mexican fern distributed as W. Oregana, var. To these I venture to add Mr. Charles Wright's No. 2,120, collected in New Mexico thirty years ago, and referred to W. obtusa in the Botany of the Mexican Boundary.","http://www.jstor.org/stable/2477316"

After the blossoms have been open several days, the style, which till then had been shorter than the stamen, elongates and protrudes from the mouth of the perianth. At first I thought this a plain arrangement for cross-fertilization, but now I am not so sure of 'it. My wife points out to me that the pollen is shed indeed before the stigma can receive it, but by a shrivelling or contraction of the perianth, is held in a mass, and may be caught by the pistil in its passage or precipitated upon it by gravity. The inflorescense is racemose or ascending. W. W. BAILEY.","http://www.jstor.org/stable/2476759"

(the E. squamatum of Nuttall) may find them in moist low grounds when they first appear in spring. Later, the fleshy scales of the bulbs decay and disappear. In autumn, they are found at the ends of slender stolons attached to the parent root. They are then about an inch long, of a dusky flesh-color, the scales regularly overlapping each other along the axis of growth, with the bud at the end. The roots spring from between the scales, and, as the latter decay as soon as their nutriment is absorbed by the growing plant, there are no bulbs to be seen by the time the flowers appear.

Note on Populus balsamifera, L. var. candicans, Gray- At the roadside, about two miles north of the city of Newburgh, on the Hudson, there is a remarkable specimen of the ""Balm of Gilead "" tree, which from its size, and probably great age, is deserving of being put on record in a botanical journal, and the more so, from the fact that the aged giant has been giving evidence for the last few years that its days are nearly numbered. In regard to this interest- ing tree (from whence a small collection of houses in the vicinity has received the name of Balmville) Mr. Ruttenber, in his History of the Town of Newburgh, gives the following facts: "" Mr. Gilbert Wil- liams, now (1875) in his 80th year, and who became a resident in its vicinity in 1808, relates that when in Nova Scotia (where he resided fornine years prior to 1832) he became acquainted with a John Cosman, who was an apprentice to Wm. Bloomer before the Revolution, who stated that while he was an apprentice he had shod horses under it many a time, and that it was a large tree then. Mr. Williams meas- ured the tree in 1832, and its circumference (two feet from the ground) was 15 feet 2 inches. He measured it again in 1868, and found it to be 19 feet 5 inches, showing its growth to have been 4 feet and 3 inches in thirty-six years. His own recollection of the tree, added to Cosman's, carries it back at least a hundred years."" There are, as might be expected of so notable an object, several traditions as to the origin of this tree. One is that the slip from which it grew was brought from New Jersey by a family of early settlers. Mr. Isaac Demott, an aged gentleman, son of one of the first settlers of the locality, and who would be likely to know more about it than any one else, told Mr. Eager, the historian of Orange County, in 1846, that "" the tree grew there naturally-that when it had grown large enough for a rail, he cut it down to use it for that purpose-that it sprouted from the root, and he let it grow."" The ""Balm of Gilead "" is said by Muhlenberg to grow in New York, but Dr. Torrey, in the Flora of the State, says: ""I have not found it indigenous within our limits."" W. R. G. The typical form of P. balsamifera occurs on the right shore of the Sacondaga River at Hope Centre, Hamilton Co., N. Y. I saw no large trees there, but there are quite a number of small size in the vicinity of a cabin which has been long unoccupied. They seemed to me to have sprung up spontaneously, perhaps suckers from larger trees that had been cut down to make the clearing. W. H. L.","http://www.jstor.org/stable/2475546"

A specimen found many years ago gave it a place in the Nereis Boreali Americana of Dr. Harvey. It was not reported again until a single specimen was found by Mr. Collins a few years since at Falmouth Heights, Mass. In 1881 I found another solitary speci- men near the same place at Menanhant, a summer settlement in Fal- mouth. In 1882 I looked in vain for it all summer long, but a single plant was found that year by Mrs. Chambre. But the latter part of July this season, after a severe south-west wind which lasted several days, this rare plant was washed up quite abundantly. I secured and mounted over eighty specimens, and might have collected many more. Some of these are about fifteen inches in length and several are complete, having the holdfast. It seems probable that it grows in the deep water in the narrow part of Vineyard Sound, and is torn up only when there is an unusual disburbance of the water. Springfield, Mass. GEORGE W.

Nomenclatural.?K document has recentlybeen issued from the herbarium of Harvard University, accompanied by a letter signed by the curator of that establishment, objecting to the system of nomenclature adopted almost unanimously by the botanists of the American Association for the Advancement of Science at meetings held in Rochester, N..Y., 1892; Madison, Wis., 1893, and Brook? lyn, N. Y., 1894, and recommending certain rules as substitutes. It seems desirable that this document be brought before our botan? ists for their kindly consideration. The principles, or it maybe better expressed, lack of princi? ples, which are here favored have, as a matter of fact, been most seriously considered by the American Association botanists for more than five years, and every one of them has been carefully weighed and found wanting in its application to a stable system of nomenclature. The proposed rules have, indeed, been framed to support what has recently been fittingly termed the "" discredited"" plan of nomenclature. Still it may be assumed that they will. receive a certain amount of support from plant collectors and physiologists, at least until more books shall have been issued based on the rules which have been proven by long trial in other branches of biological science to give nomenclature the stability which is so necessary. The way for these has been paved by that magnificent work, the "" Silva of North America,"" the most ex? haustive and elegant botanical publication yet produced in our country; by several State and local floras; and by other papers too numerous to mention. The want of easily accessible descrip? tive floras, written on this very practical system approved by the botanists of the American Association, is the only circumstance which retards its still wider adoption. There is every reason to- believe that, these will soon be supplied.","http://www.jstor.org/stable/2478169"

"1887-07-01","Note on a new North American Lichen. DERMATISCUM PORCELANUM, Nyl., n. sp. In the supple- ment to my ""Introduction,"" etc., I ventured to describe a sin- gular plant from South Carolina as Buellia Catawbensis. Had I known that the plant had been sent to Dr. Nylander, before that sheet was printed, I should have withheld it. Dr. Nylander, in a letter to Prof. A. H. Green, who sent him specimens, gives the plant the name at the head of this article. Dermatiscum is a genus founded upon Endocarpon Thunbergii, Ach. Syn., p. IOI, a South African lichen. It is placed by Nylander, in his Synop- sis among the Lecanorei, just before Urceolaria. The description of Endocarpon Thunbergii, Ach., is: "" Thallo crasso crustaceo-cartilagineo foliaceo orbiculari-repando peltato flavo-viridi subtus nudo nigro-fusco; ostiolis demum subglobosis atris."" This, so far as the thallus is concerned, applies closely to our plant, excepting as regards color. But Acharius appears to have mistaken the character of the fruit. A description of the genus was given by Nylander in Mohl & de Bary's Bot. Zeit., 1867, p. I33. I have not seen it. Umbilicaria flavo-virescens, Leight., in Journ. Linn. Soc., 169, pp. 33-35, is a synonym of the African plant. H. WILLEY.","http://www.jstor.org/stable/2475531"

Growth of Exogens. -The recent observations on this subject by Mr. Willis and Mr. Waring remind us , that Lindley, in the Penny Cyclopaedia, and in the Vegetable Kingdom, under the head of Exogens, has treated of some remarkable anomalies of growth, and refers to similar observations made by Jussieu, Schultz, Decaisne, Gaudichaud, Schleiden and others. We hope that some new light will be thrown on the subject from the present fresh start. Calycan- thus, (Lind. Veg. King. sub. voce,) presents a fine subject for study. Mr. Willis reminds us that in the Spring of 1877 he presented to the club a number of the cross sections of exogenous stems and took occasion to draw attention to abnormal formations of rings of growth, in some of them, one in Robinia Pseudacacia, which seemed to be pinched off on one side or to fade quite away, while some in a cross section of Rhizophora Mangel appeared not only to present complete faults, to use a geological expression, but to possess no corresponding part on the other side of the centre of growth. In a specimen of Abies Canadensis, appeared a wide semi-ring the ends of which were pinched off on opposite sides of the half section, the termini presenting a cuneate form. He had also noticed the same thing in an oak.'","http://www.jstor.org/stable/2475602"

A person in no way a botanist, though after his fashion a lover of the woods, confessed to me that he was in the habit during his rambles of scattering seeds of foreign or western Ilants here in Rlhode Island. Now, if these germinated, as no doubt they often did, they would give rise to plants quite extra-regional. This, when it first was noticed, might cause the experienced student no great annoyance, but it is easy to see that after a while, and when well established, they might easily mislead. There is no way that I can suggest of stopping such a custom in our free country. The question is how far is it reprehensible? W. W. BAILEY.","http://www.jstor.org/stable/2475482"

Our thanks are due to Dr. Gray for his criticism and correc- tion, in the January number of this journal, as regards the earliest name, Myosurus apetalus, Gay, for the plant which we all had so long been taught to call M. aristatus. That the form which he designates as var. lepturus, belongs under this species, rather than under M. minimus, where we had placed it, we can- not easily be persuaded, who are familiar with all these plants as they grow in the fields, and are moreover supplied with abun- dant Pacific coast specimens gathered in all stages of maturity; advantages which our learned Cambridge friend admits he has not enjoyed. With reference to the Drummondian specimens of M. Shortii, so long ago distributed by Sir William Hooker, it was not pre- sumed that no true Myosuzrus would be found among them. We only spoke for that representation of the distribution which the herbarium of the California Academy has been favored with. The specimens are two only, and neither of them in flower. The leaves in both display the scattered but prominent spreading teeth of a small plantain; and the reddish, villous pubescence about the bases of the leaves and scapes are the second mark, equally unmistakeable with that aforenamed, of the genus Plan- tago, as compared with Myosurus. The species, however, must be P. heterophylla, rather than P. pusilla, which latter has its leaves entire. EDWARD LEE GREENE.","http://www.jstor.org/stable/2476757"

When flowers are abundant they visit those only which they prefer, at other times they examine any thing which comes in their way. I have seen honey bees attack the vine- yard; though, as a general thing, it would be safe to say they would not eat grapes. At the time I am writing, May 18th, there is a dearth of garden flowers. Those of the early spring are gone, and the later ones are not well forward. But Aquilegiae in many species are in bloom. The humble-bee bores the ends of the nectaries, and sucks the honey stored there; and the honey-bee follows and sucks from the same hole what may be left, or what may be afterwards generated from the honey gland. I have often watched closely to learn whether the honey-bee bored for honey. Its quick motions are unfavorable to correct observation. I thought once I had caught it boring lilac flowers, but I afterwards counted all the flowers that had been bored by the humble bee, and then watched the work of the honey bee on the cluster, and there were no more bored afterwards than before. The Aquilegiae with curved nectaries, such as A. vulgaris and A. Olymtpica are very favorable for observation, as the slit is made on the upper side of the curve, and the honey-bee can be easily seen following after the crumbs that have been left on the strong one's table. I have no doubt, however, it would bore for itself if it had the power, and it perhaps sometimes does. The humble-bee and the honey-bee are evidently not the insects for which the Aquilegia had this beautifully contrived nectar cup provided to induce cross-fertili- zation, and what particular insect was designed to be the favored one, so that it and no other could turn its tongue around these twisted spurs to get at the honey in the end, I think no student has dis- covered.

We saw some bushes of Pinus inops, Ait., almost stripped of their leaves by caterpillars. The most abundant growth of Apo- cynum cannabinum, L., that we have met with near the city, was just beyond Red Bank Light, along the shore, the nearest I.R. station being Pleasant Plains. Tecoma radicans, Juss., is perfectly at home here, spreading over the sand, and climbing the bushes, particularly a group of self-sown Ailanthus glandulosus, Desf., which was in a blaze with the showy trumpets. The shore in the same locality was covered with Artemisia caudata, Mchx., which has not before been re- ported from the Island. We picked up a pretty sound twig or root, into a minute crevice of whose bark some grass ( Calamagrostis are- naria, probably) had inserted its fibrous root. The fibre had passed between the bark and wood, and had found its way out some inches away on the other side. The openings in both cases were so per- fectly filled by the fibre of the grass root, that it seemed to have bored its way through the hard bark, which must have been one-six- teenth of an inch in thickness. My companion had often noticed similar appearances in the Northern woods. Terms--One dollar for one copy: fire dollars for Seven: and half a dollar for every additional copy, per annum.

Proceedings of the Torrey Club.-The regular meeting of the Club was held at the Herbarium, Columbia College, Tuesday evening, May 10th, the President in the chair and twenty-six mem- bers present. Miss Knight read a list of 28 plants found during the field meet- ing, May 7th, at Bronxville This locality was found to be a new station for Dentaria diphylla and Mitella diphylla. Plants exhibited.--Mr. Wr. F. Miller exhibited an interesting col- lection of Alpine plants. Dr. Kunze, in behalf of Mr. I. S. Buchan- an, distributed flowering specimens taken from a graft grown from the noted pear-tree which, up to the time of its destruction in 1867, stood on the corner of Third Avenue and Thirteenth Street, a local- ity in the early history of the island forming a portion of the farm of Petrus Stuyvesant, the last Dutch director general of New Netherland (New York). Mr. Bicknell exhibited and remarked upon the following Teratological specimens - Dicentra Cucullaria, DC., showing fission of the scape as far as the flowering portion extended; Anem- one Hepatica, L., having three flowers, subtended by a common in- volucre, at the apex of the scape; catkins of Salix, some of which were proliferous and bore two diverging ovaries on a common pedi- cel, and one of the specimens, moreover, bearing ovaries, within many of which were found poliniferous anthers. Mr. Brown remarked on the similarity of habit of several Compos- itae, such as Anthemis Cotufa, DC., Anthemis arvensis, L.. Matricaria Chamomilla and Chrysanthemum inodorum, and gave some practical hints as to how they might be readily distinguished from each other. The presentation, by Mr. Willis, of specimens of Cypripedium pu- bescens, from White Plains, gave rise to a discussion on the subject of orchids which consumed the remainder of the evening. The resignation of Mr. Schrenk as a member of the field-day committee was accepted, and Dr. Schony was appointed in his stead. One active member was elected.

A small patch of this pretty little plant grows in the piece of woods situated on the north side of Jackson Av., just two miles from Hunter's Point, by the mile-stone. It grows a little distance within the Astoria side of the woods, on the banks of a brooklet. This is, I believe, the only known station on Long Island. M. R.","http://www.jstor.org/stable/2476809"

"1877-02-01","? 147. On the means of protection in flowers against unwel- come visitors.-In Natzre, Jan. ii, Vol. XV., p. 237, is an exceed- ingly interesting account of a monograph by M. Kerner, of the Zoological-Botanical Society in Vienna, on this subject. We have space but to indicate the tenor of this paper, and to recommend it to the notice of those who seek in ""morphological characters a biological significance."" M. Kerner gives an account of the manifold forms which are of use to guard flowers against uninvited guests, wingless insects, for example, who would be of little service in con- veying the pollen from one plant to another. One means of protec- tion consists in isolation by water; sometimes collected in the axils of the leaves (from which circumstance perhaps Aquilegia gets its name); sometimes surrounding this plant, as in Polygonum amphi- bium. "" When, however, the water has run off, and the plant is on dry ground, there develop on the leaves and stalks gland-hairs, which secrete a sticky matter, rendering the flower-bearing axis all smeary, so that access is equally forbidden to the creeping insects. If, now, a plant of Polygonum, bearing these gland hairs, be put in the water again, the trichome-tufts, with their sticky material, disappear, and the surface appears once more smooth and even.""
