# Using R to Create R Study Guide

## Class Assignment

The study guide development will go for five weeks, so everyone can have a change to look at each of the for frameworks and then one session to integrate everything into one document. See Sakai to see your group assignment.

```{r  out.width = "20%", eval=TRUE, fig.cap="Calystegia purpurata is a species of morning glory known by the common name Pacific false bindweed. It is endemic to California, where it grows in the seaside scrub of the coastline and the chaparral of the coastal and inland valleys."}
knitr::include_graphics("/home/mwl04747/beginnersluck/Stats/EA30_Study_Guide/Calystegic_purpurata.jpg") 
```


## Developing Content

Each week, I intend to dedicate 30-45 minutes to develop content. 

We'll start with creating an example. But as we do, we want to be answering these following questions:

- What questions can be answered with the method?
- Are their limitations to the method?
- What are the assumptions?
- How can the assumptions be tested?
- Create R code to explore some examples
- <span style="color:blue">Put comments (using # symbol) after R code to help others understand what's going on.
- <span style="color:blue">Create a "list of R functions" in Appendix 1
- <span style="color:blue">Create a study guide "test", evaluation questions, Appendix 2.</span>

The example should include data to be analyzed -- either imported or created in R, then the R codes to analyze the results and then a discussion about how to interpret the data.

After each week, please upload the version you have edited and I will harmonize the 4 groups work into one document for the following week.

# Getting Started with R

## R and Rstudio

### What is R?

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, etc.) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. 

One of R's strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formula where needed. 

### Getting started in R

TBD

If you havenâ€™t used R before, start by downloading R and R Studio.  <span style="color:blue">.MLH: Not sure what this is here for...</span>

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars) # extract summary statistics from built-in cars dataset.
```

I added the comment line to help the reader remember what's happening. These comments are useful to help everyone see the intentions of the author. 



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. But as a guide, we might want to show the code -- which can be done with `echo = TRUE`, which is the default. 

## Updated Template to Create Study Guide

I created this document to give you a "head-start" in creating the study guide with a format that everyone can use. By using Rstudio, you will have the capacity to create an integrated approach that merges R commands and outputs and text. 

I have defined the output as a word document to start with -- but we can create a pdf or html output if we decide that is better. But by putting into Word, we can use Word to spot typos easier!

There are ways to share these documents via github.com -- but frankly, it works great if the class is smaller, e.g. 10-12. So, we'll use an assortment of sakai upload tools -- not ideal, but I'll make it work!

## Editing the Guide

<span style="color:blue">After extracting the zip file, you will see several files that make up the study guide. When submitting your edits, please zip the files so all the files you have used will be available to others. 

## Run the Template

Make sure the template you downloaded runs!  Nothing is more frustrating (hyperbole?) than trying to troubleshoot someone else's code!

# Variables and Statistics

## Defining Variable Types

### Continuous vs. Count vs. Categorical

<span style="color:blue">MLH: Describe...these...

We can interrogate the data if we are unsure using the str() function, which coerces the data.frame into a format to evaluate the structure.

```{r}
str(pressure)
```

In this case, we find that the object "pressure" is a data.frame that is composed of two variables -- and both seem to be numeric.

## Example of Plastic Data...

```{r}

```


### Dependent vs. Independent Data (add text here...)

In some cases, we can manipulate an environmental setting or characteristic and test the impact on another characteristics. We generally call the one that we can manipulate as the independent variable and the measured response as the dependent variable. 

Graphically, we often see the independent variable as the x-axis. The independent call might also be referred to as the predictor variable. The response as the dependent (or response) variable. 

In our titles, we often refer to the dependent first -- "Response as a Function of X" or "Water Temperature vs. Air Temperature"

NOTE: Spatial Data and Time Series data have special concerns. For example, when we take a sample from a creek every day -- the creek water might be different, but the processes that contribute to its characteristics are quite similar, compared to water from another creek. Thus, we might note that the samples taken are autocorrelated. 

"Auto-correlation"..., see below...[Autocorrelation Section](#autocorrelation)

#### Graphical Example of Independent and Dependent Variables

Plotting data as a data.frame is pretty straightforward, but there are two main syntax methods. 

1. Define x and y in the plot function: 

```{r}
plot(x=pressure$temperature, y=pressure$pressure) # Notice the data.frame is explicitly referenced and then the variable of interest after the dollar symbol.
```

2. Alternatively, you can use the formula syntax:

```{r}
plot(pressure ~ temperature, data=pressure) # in this case the data.frame is called by the "data=" argument.
```







# Four Frameworks

## Linear Regression

MLH: What is linear Regression

Calystegia: Linear regression is one of the most commonly used predictive analyses. It answers the question:Does a set of predictor variables do a good job in predicting an outcome (dependent) variable? <span style="color:blue">link to definition</span>. It's used to predict the value of a variable (the dependent variable) based on an input value (the independent/predictor variable)

MLH: What kinds of questions is the linear regression best suited for? 

Calystegia: It’s used to answer questions about the relationship between two variables or the strength of a cause/effect relationship. It also is helpful if you have multiple independent variables because you can find out which variable(s) best predicts the dependent variable. <span style="color:blue">Let's define the difference between correlation and causation...<\span>

MLH: What are the “under the hood methods” used to analyze the data? Is this supported by theory? Is there any of the theory that’s useful for users? 

Calytegia: Linear regression is best visualized on a scatterplot. Linear regression will fit a straight line on the plot (a line of best fit) and will measure the distance between the actual values and the predicted values on the line to determine how well the line predicts the values.


## Linear Regression Examples

### Example #1

We know surface water temperatures depend on the sunlight. But what about surface air temperature?


Is water and air temperature correlated?  (whats the difference between correlation and regression?)

Calytegia: Correlation doesn’t say anything about cause and effect while regression does. Regression expresses the cause and effect relationship between variables in the form of an equation.

```{r}
water = c(50, 52, 65, 67, 68, 78, 54, 63, 57, 58)
air = c(60, 75, 85, 86, 73, 76, 78, 92, 59,62)
lm(formula = water ~ air)

```

making a graph...
```{r}

plot(x=air, y=water, main="water ~ air")  # This was a scatterplot, but marc changed it to a "plot" on 4/1 because it wasn't clear what the model was in the curvy scatter plot approach. 
#linearMod <- lm(water ~ air, data=temperature)  # build linear regression model on full data
#print(linearMod)


```

### Example #2: SRP and HABs

Following HABs and SRP as a predictor...

MLH: Describe why these data can be analyzed using regression

Calystegia: These data can be analyzed using a linear regression (specifically a simple linear regression) because they are both quantitative forms of data and we are trying to determine if they have a cause and effect relationship, between an independent and dependent variable.

##### Define Data:

MLH: What's the rcode doing here?

```{r}
SRP <- c(.02, .03, 0.4, 0.04, .05, 0.033, 1.4)
cyano<- c(22, 34, 23, 22, 23, 2, 122)

```

#### Create Linear Model using lm() function

The linear model coerces the data into a new object using a least squares method to calculate the slope and intercept (and other statistical date.)

MLH: What's the rcode doing here?

```{r}
HAB.lm = lm(cyano ~ SRP)
HAB.lm 
```

#### Model Summary (Results)
Let's look at the model results with summary()


MLH: What's the rcode doing here?

MLH: Describe results...

 Calytegia: The results of this linear regression demonstrate a relationship between SRP and HABs, but it is not a significant one (p-value = 0.06563). There some relationship between the data as demonstrated by the R2 vaue being 0.886, but the p-value demonstrates that it’s not a very significant relationship.



```{r}
summary(HAB.lm)
```


MLH: What's the rcode doing here?

MLH: maybe make better x and y labels?

```{r}
plot(cyano ~ SRP, las=1, main="title", pch=20)
abline(HAB.lm, col="blue")
```

#### Model Interpretation (Discussion)


##### Linear Regression Assumptions

Let's look at a default plot of model...

MLH: What do these mean?

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(HAB.lm)
```

## Logistic Regression

MLH:  What is this used for? 

MLH: What are good questions for this?

### Example \#1 Gradaute School Admissions -- MLH: Too Complicated...

This data predicts graduate school admission (discreet/binary) based on GRE score (continuous), GPA (continuous), and school prestige (discreet/binary, 1-4). This is a great resource to perform this: https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/dae/logit-regression/


```{r}
#### Name the data
mydata <- read.csv("https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/binary.csv")

####   View the first few rows of the data
head(mydata)

####   Create a 5 number summary
summary(mydata)


```

MLH:  I have simplified it to one variable... trying to stay focused on simple analyses!

MLH:What is the family=binomial for?
```{r}
mydata$rank <- factor(mydata$rank)
mylogit <- glm(admit ~ gre, data = mydata, family = "binomial")
```

```{r}
summary(mylogit)
```
```{r}
#define new data frame that contains predictor variable
newdata <- data.frame(gre=seq(min(mydata$gre), max(mydata$gre),len=100))

#use fitted model to predict values of vs
newdata$admit = predict(mylogit, newdata, type="response")
```


```{r}

#plot logistic regression curve
plot(jitter(admit) ~ gre, data=mydata, col="steelblue", las=1)
lines(admit ~ gre, newdata, lwd=2)

```

### Example \#2: Algae Concentration and Toxicity

Toxicity is a measure of toxity based on organism responses, often measured as LD50s, where 50% of the populations dies at a certain concentration. 

Here we use the results of different concentrations of a toxin and the number of surviving Daphnia -- a very common freshwater test organism.

MLH: Describe DATA...

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Dose = c(0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0)
Survived = c(18, 19, 12, 5, 6, 2, 1)
Died = c(7, 6, 13, 20, 19, 23, 24)

Survived.1 = data.frame(Dose = rep(Dose, Survived), Result = 1)
Died.1 = data.frame(Dose = rep(Dose, Died), Result = 0)

Results.df = rbind(Survived.1, Died.1)
str(Results.df)
Results.df <- Results.df[order(Results.df$Dose),]

```

Create a nice table of results... 

MLH: what are ones and zeros?
```{r}


table(Results.df)

```


```{r}
#Results.df$Result <- as.factor(Results.df$Result)
Results.logit <- glm(Result ~ Dose, data = Results.df, family = "binomial")
```

### Results

MLH:  What do these results mean?

```{r}
summary(Results.logit)
```
#### Interpretation (Discussion)

```{r}
#define new data frame that contains predictor variable
newdata <- data.frame(Dose=seq(min(Results.df$Dose), max(Results.df$Dose),len=100))

#use fitted model to predict values of vs
newdata$Result = predict(Results.logit, newdata, type="response")
```

```{r}

#plot logistic regression curve
plot(Result ~ jitter(Dose), data=Results.df, col="steelblue", las=1)
lines(Result ~ Dose, newdata, lwd=2)

```
LD50 = dose at which Pr(dead | dose) = 0.5. 

MLH: found this formula online... don't know if it works... 

$$ ln(\frac{\frac{1}{2}}{1-\frac{1}{2}}) = \beta_1 + \beta_0 (LD_{50}) $$

$$  0 =  \beta_1 + \beta_0 (LD_{50})$$
$$ \widehat{{LD_{50}} = \frac{- \beta_0}{\beta_1}} $$

Calculating Standard Error... MLH: Haven't tried this yet



proportion dead 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0 2 ˆ + SE(ˆ1) ˆ 1 LD50 2 cov(ˆ0, ˆ1) ˆ 0 ˆ1

### Example #3
Will a person win an election?


MLH:  What is this used for? 
Logistic regression is used when the predictor/independent variable is categorical and the  response/dependent variable is continuous. 

MLH: What are good questions for this?
Possible questions may include - will an indiviudal win the election?  predictor = number of votes; response = win or loss

## ANOVA

What is a one-way ANOVA?

What is the ANOVA used for?



## Example 1: Simulated HAB Data

Five mesocosms have been randomly selected to test the impact of zebra mussels on cyanobacteria concentrations, while five are controls. Water is circulate in each, and the experiment sampled the water column for bacteria counts every day for 10 days.

Here are the (fake) data:

Controls have a mean of 35 (and Standard Deviation of 8), Low Density treatment has a mean of 33 (SD = 8) and high density mean of 31 (SD=8)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# R code not printed with "echo=FALSE"
mesocosm = rep(1:15, 10); mesocosm
treatment = c(rep("Control", 50), rep("LD", 50), rep("HD", 50)); treatment
day = rep(1, times=10 ); day
results = round(c(rnorm(50, 35, 8), rnorm(50, 33, 8), rnorm(50, 31, 8)), 1); results
Mussel = data.frame(Mesocosm = mesocosm, Treatment = treatment, Day=day, Results=results)
```

### First six observations and histograms

```{r}
head(Mussel)
```

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
hist(Mussel$Results[Mussel$Treatment=="Control"])
hist(Mussel$Results[Mussel$Treatment=="LD"])
hist(Mussel$Results[Mussel$Treatment=="HD"])

```

### Create AOV Object (Analysis of Variance) Using Least Squares Method

What are least squares?
```{r}

Mussel.aov <- aov(results ~ treatment, data=Mussel)
```

### Results


```{r}

summary(Mussel.aov)
```

### Exploring Chaning Parameters

<span style="color:blue">MLH:Play with means or SD to see how it changes results 

A lower standard deviation meant that the data were more clustered around the mean -- <span style="color:blue">MLH:  this is doesn't not tell the reader much... what about the summary, p value, ect?

#### Change Mean

<span style="color:blue">MLH: add rcode and describe results

#### Change SD

<span style="color:blue">MLH: add rcode and describe results


#### Change N

MLH: add rcode and describe results


### Some graphical Displays

Using a normal distribution, what do the data look like?

The data is symmetrically distributed with no skew. 

MLH: What do these mean?

```{r}
newresults = seq(min(Mussel$Results), max(Mussel$Results), length=500)
plot(newresults, dnorm(newresults, mean=mean(Mussel$Results[Mussel$Treatment=="Control"])), ty="l", xlim=c(25,40), col="darkgreen", lwd=1.4)
lines(newresults, dnorm(newresults, mean=mean(Mussel$Results[Mussel$Treatment=="LD"])), ty="l", col="darkred", lwd=1.4)
lines(newresults, dnorm(newresults, mean=mean(Mussel$Results[Mussel$Treatment=="HD"])), ty="l", col="purple", lwd=1.4)

```

### Power Analaysis -- ANOVA and Sample Size

Use this example: https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/dae/one-way-anova-power-analysis/ and create an "environmental example" and translate the results for class


## Tests for Association

Contributions to date: Eriogonum, Calystegia, Phacelia

Example description (making this concrete at the start is useful): 

MLH: What is this test used for?

This test is used to determine association between two treatments (or differences). An example could be Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) as a treatment with Hospital Asthma Cases as an output. Could show the relation between HABs and Asthma Cases going to the hospital. Chi-Square tests for independence/association can only be used between categorical variables.


MLH: What is this test used for?

Answer: There are several tests for association. One of the more popular is the Chi-squared test ($\Chi^2$ test). 

A Chi-Squared test is used to determine the association between two categorical variables. The null hypothesis is no association between the two independent variables.


H+M: Strengths of this test = helps measure how a model compares the actual observed data, tells us if two variables are independent of one another. 


MLH:  Are their assumptions to be concerned about?

The chi-squared test assumes that both variables are are categorical and independent. Assumes that the values are mutually exclusive as well. Data must be frequency data and this test is used when there are larger values. It makes no assumption about the distribution of the data.

The data in the cells should be frequencies, or counts of cases rather than percentages or some other transformation of the data. Categories of the variables are mutually exclusive (one cannot receive the treatment AND not receive the treatment). All observations must be independent. <span style="color:blue">what does independent mean?



### Example 1

Hospital asthema cases and HABs in Florida <span style="color:blue">MLH: Please flesh out example...


#### Creating Data (as a table)

<span style="color:blue">MLH: Describe what's happening here...

```{r}
HAB.tab = c(20, 15, 98, 223)
sum(HAB.tab)
dim(HAB.tab) = c(2,2)
dimnames(HAB.tab) = list(c("Non-HAB", "HAB"), c("No Hospitalizations", "Hospitalizations"))

HAB.tab

#HAB.mat = matrix(HAB.tab, nrow=2)
```



```{r}
table(HAB.tab)
```

<span style="color:blue">Describe chisq.test

```{r}

chisq.test(HAB.tab)
```

# Other Types the Might be Important (Marc might discuss if we have time...)

## Count Data

## Multiple Regression

## Two-Way and Mult-Way ANOVAs

### Example \#1 --Fertilizer and Crop Yield MLH: Better for Multiway ANOVA

##Looked at Scribbr; entered the crop data to R as a csv##
##Question: How does fertilizer effect crop yield? Testing three different fertilizers##
##command to read the data##
crop.data <- read.csv("crop.data.csv", header)
##command to summarize and make sure everything is working##
summary(crop.data)
str(crop.data)
##use to perform a one.way ANOVA##
##One way ANOVA has one independent independent variable##
##This one way ANOVA models crop yield as a function of the type of fertilizer used##
one.way <- aov(yield~fertilizer,data=crop.data)
##shows what the data compiles into after a one.way##
summary(one.way)
##use to perform a two.way ANOVA##
##Two way ANOVA utilizes two independent variables##
##This two way models crop yield as a function of type of fertilizer and planting density##
##Just have to add a plus icon and the extra independent variable##
two.way <- aov(yield ~ fertilizer + density, data = crop.data)
##shows what the data compiles into after a two.way##
summary(two.way)
##Interaction between variables##
##Used to test whether two variables have an interaction effect##
interaction <- aov(yield ~ fertilizer*density, data = crop.data)
summary(interaction)

MLH --    The example relies on external data, which adds a step that gets in the way. I suggest we developed example two to keep it simpler...

Research question: Which fertilizer produces the most crop yield? ##Independent variable/predictor: Fertilizer A, Fertilizer B, Fertilizer C ##Dependent variable/response: amount of crop yield

Question: Which fertilizer provides the best crop yield?

It is common for factors to be read as quantitative variables when importing a dataset into R. To avoid this, you can use the read.csv() command to read in the data, specifying within the command whether each of the variables should be quantitative (â€œnumericâ€) or categorical (â€œfactorâ€).

##Use the following code, replacing the path/to/your/file text with the actual path to your file:


```{r}
# install.packages(c(“ggplot2”, “ggpubr”, “tidyverse”, “broom”, “AICcmodavg”)) 

# Read Data
# crop.data.csv = file.choose()

crop.data.csv  = "/home/mwl04747/beginnersluck/Stats/EA30_Study_Guide/ANOVA_cropdata.csv"
crop.data <- read.csv(crop.data.csv)

names(crop.data)
crop.data.aov <- aov(Yield ~ Fertilizer, data=crop.data)

summary(crop.data.aov)

```
