## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Load the party package. It will automatically load other
# dependent packages.
library(party)

# Print some records from data set readingSkills.
print(head(readingSkills))

test <- data.frame(task = c("Teaching", "Preparing Lecture", "Grading", "Office Hours",
                    "EnviroLab Asia", "Global Initiative",
                    "Research Writing", "Research Background", "Research Data Analysis", 
                    "EA Steering", "Portfolio"),
           time = c(240, 600, 270, 180, 
                    60, 60, 
                    420, 240, 120, 
                    30, 30),
           accountability = c("Yes", "Yes", "No", "Yes", 
                              "Yes", "Yes", 
                              "No", "No", "No", 
                              "Yes", "No"),
           indespensibily = c(1, 1, .4, .7, 
                              .5, .4, 
                              .1, .2, .2, 
                              1, .5),
           promotion = c(1, 1, 1, .8, 
                         .3, .3, 
                         .5, .4, .3, 
                         .5, 1)
           )
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(party)
# library(grid, mvtnorm, modeltools, strucchange, zoo)

# Create the input data frame.
input.dat <- readingSkills[c(1:105),]
input.dat2 <- test


# Give the chart file a name.
#png(file = "decision_tree.png")

# Create the tree.
  output.tree <- ctree(
  nativeSpeaker ~ age + shoeSize + score, 
  data = input.dat)
  
  output.tree2 <- ctree(
    
  )

# Plot the tree.
plot(output.tree)

# Save the file.
#dev.off()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
