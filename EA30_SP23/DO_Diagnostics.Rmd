## Practicing Import Data

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r import}
# pasted commands
filepath.csv = "/home/mwl04747/beginnersluck/EA30_SP23/Field Data Recording (master sheet) - Data.csv"

## read.csv

import = read.csv(filepath.csv)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r DOplot, echo=FALSE}
plot(HDO..Sat ~ Depth.m, data=import, pch=20, xlab="Depth (m)", ylab="DO (% Sat)", las=1, main="Dissolved Oxygen vs. Depth, pHake Lake Spring 2023")
#$abline(coef(DO.lm), col="red")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
DO.lm <- lm(HDO..Sat ~ Depth.m, data=import)
summary(DO.lm)
```
```{r}
plot(DO.lm)
```
