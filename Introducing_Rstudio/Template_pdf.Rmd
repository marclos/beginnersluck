## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r maunaloa}
maunaloa <- read.csv("http://pages.pomona.edu/~mwl04747/Mauna_Loa.csv")
head(maunaloa)
str(maunaloa)
plot(maunaloa$average ~ maunaloa$decimal.date, ty="l")
maunaloa.lm <- lm(average ~ decimal.date, data=maunaloa)
summary(maunaloa.lm)
abline(coef(maunaloa.lm), col="red")
```
